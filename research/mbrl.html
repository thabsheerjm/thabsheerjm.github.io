    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Behavior Cloning models are sample inefficient and fails to generalize to simple tasks like pick and place. 
      Even with DataAggregation techniques (DAgger) the agent fails to learn general behavior.
      In this work we formalize a general dynamics model that can give the manipulator the ability make intelligent decision while learning from expert demonstarations.

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>To simplify the study we start with a simple task, pick and place with known poses. The problem
        was simple enough the agent had to copy the behavior of expert joint space PD controller. The
        task here is to pick up and item from one location and placing it in another. We begin with uniform
        shaped cubes and later procedurally deform the shapes to see how the arm perform.</p>
    
    <h3>Behavior Cloning Without a world model</h3>
    Behavior cloning(BC) is a popular imitation learning method where a policy is trained to reproduce
    expert behavior using supervised learning.
